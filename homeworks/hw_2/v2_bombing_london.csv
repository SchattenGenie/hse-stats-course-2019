They were operating from a secluded spot in<br>the forest, providing as much camouflage as possible from prowling Allied fighter aircraft.  The detonating platoon then raised the Rocket vertically on the firing table, aligned its electronics, set the gyros and armed the weapon.  From the time the rocket was fuelled<br>to when it was fired took 90 minutes. The officer gave the order for the first V2 to be fired that day at 5.57am.  Its destination was the North London area. <br>At that moment, aged 2years 9 months, I was<br>asleep in bed with my mother at our home on the ground floor of a house at 121, Axminster Road,<br>Islington, North London.  My father was in Northern Italy serving in the British Eighth Army, having landed in Salerno from North Africa some months earlier, later fighting at Monte Cassino<br>and by this date, nearing Milan.<br><br>Two minutes after leaving Holland, the rocket impacted in the rear gardens of houses opposite and the roof and upper floors of our home<br>crashed down upon us. Although still an infant I can vaguely remember being held by my mother and an axe head coming through a door.  After being freed and receiving remedial treatment we were evacuated to relatives in Herefordshire where we stayed until 1947 when my father was demobbed and our home rebuilt.<br><br>The houses opposite were totally destroyed and many years later replaced by a large block of flats – now known as Bennett Court. My mother was greatly affected by this tragedy, following<br>as it did an earlier “near miss with death” when the Maternity Home where I was born was destroyed during the Blitz shortly after she had taken me home.  Superficially Mother’s main concerns and anguish were based upon the loss of all her wedding presents which had been<br>stolen by looters, probably members of the Auxiliary Fire Service who rescued us.",-0.11799,51.560097

All the doors and windows were blown in and there was glass everywhere. We has some Canadian soldiers in the house at the time the V2 hit they along with my Father rushed over to Calton Road to help the injured. I believe that there was a horse drawn milk float in the road at the time the V2 struck both the roundsmen and the poor horse were killed along with 12 others in the houses on the north side of the road. Our house escaped much of the damage due to the row of houses across the road from us that took most of the blast. Later I lived in West End Lane , High Barnet where just across the road from my house and the Lord Nelson Pub, in Bells Hill another bomb ( I think it was an Aerial Land Mine) killed a lot of people.

He dug with his hands until he exposed her face believe she was still breathing but we never did a follow up to see if she survived. It was a Saturday so although my infant school was bombed no children were there it also destroyed part of the Rialto Cinema. When the new type rocket dropped in leyton it evidently I was told killed a woman post officer. I was playing in my school playground at Connaught road school and as usual gazing up at the clouds to imagine pictures when what looked like a slim silver pencil was going across the sky. Of course I screamed out for everyone to look because had never seen anything like it! They were completely silent on their approach unlike the V1 and remember having to go to the headmasters study where I believe a man from the ministry asked me to describe it and draw it. I later found out in dropped in Leyton not far from my school. It must have been play break at the school as was playing in the playground and remember it was a lovely sunny day. Just thought would share this with you. Have so many memories of the war years and living in Leytonstone as a child luckily we never had a direct hit plenty of blasts though all the time. Would love to know if that lady in Lemna road survived I believe it was a block of flats! Perhaps I will receive some replies to this?"" - from Christine Brennan.",0.011233,51.570038

Possible witness testimony from website: ""I have a recorded conversation with my Uncle Dave Holley who remembers a V2 rocket falling on Raymouth Road in Bermondsey. It fell at the Southwark Park end of the road and demolished a hotel.He said it made a terrific bang and there was a smell of explosive, all the doors and windows blew open and a piece of paneling came off of his kitchen door.He popped up the road to see what had happened.He said when he got to Raymouth Road it was empty, nobody was about at first. There was lots of broken glass on the floor.He said he went a bit further up the road and noticed that there was a lady who was about 45-50 and who was holding a toddlers hand. The lady was running up and down and shouting out something she looked really confused and shocked.She crossed the road towards my Uncle and kept shouting out ""what shall I do,what shall I do!?"" the little toddler was very scared. My Uncle asked her whats the matter,whats happened? She said they have just killed my husband.He asked her how did it happen?. She explained that she had been in a house at the top of the road and opposite where she was there was a hotel, she said that thing came over referring to the rocket. She explained that her husband was not a drinking man but every Sunday before dinner was cooked he would nip over to the hotel and play a round of draughts with his mates.He would always come back in time for dinner. On this occasion he told her he was going over there and would be back shortly.However the rocket came over and must of hit the hotel as there was now a massive hole where it had been that stretched from the back of the gardens right across the road,blowing the basements out.She said that there had been a massive explosion which blew the roof of the hotel up with it crashing down into the hole where the hotel had been. She said my husband was in there. My Uncle said she was besides herself she didn't know what she was doing.He asked her if she knew anybody who lived in the area? at first she said no but then she recalled that her daughter and son in law lived in a house just a little way down the road.She was so shocked she had forgotten.My Uncle said it was terrible having someone come up to you and say there husband was dead like that,he really didn't know what to say.""",-0.060232,51.492126

How unlucky was that ? Two other details come to mind about that terrible night. We all remembered our Grandfather emerging through the rubble in his woolly combs.and shouting above the chaos that he couldn't find his trousers.

""The Palmer Place V2 hit very close indeed to where my father was living - although his address was Morgan Road I think the front door was on Palmer Place itself but he believes the reason why he (and his family) survived is that it hit in some open land but a big bank of soil had been piled up high between where the V2 landed and the road so the blast was deflected upwards. Otherwise he feels sure the building he was in would have been demolished with him in it.""<br><br>Comment from Anita Welsh: My mothers family were killed in Palmer Place, Islington in the New Years Eve V bombing, gather many were in a pub on the street celebrating New Year. I understand that 102 people were killed that night just on this street. I was a 2 yr old fast asleep, and survived, after my fathers brother, then a boy scout dug through the rubble searching for me. I was born there, and never have been back, as I came to live in Canada.

It was Woodville Road as earlier discussed in this forum. Here is an account from my mother who was 14 at the time. 'I was 14 at the time and living at 64 Maybank avenue. My mother was three months pregnant. We had stopped using our Anderson shelter because it always flooded. We were inside the Morrison shelter in the front room. Myself, Mother and brother squeezed in. The night had been really bad – freezing and snowing. We had been listening to the radio. The explosion knocked the windows in. I can’t remember the exact time but think is was between 9-10. My mother ran out shortly after the explosion. She was running across the road to my grandparents to check on them. Mr Bennet who was the air raid warden and our neighbor brought her back in. Her feet were bleeding. A lot of people were killed including two children. I think it had the worst fatalities of any V2.""<br><br><br>From Andrew Walker in response to Chris: ""20th January 1945, which was a Saturday, 10.49pm, the 575th V2 rocket recorded by the RAF as landing on the UK in its list of ""Big Ben"" incidents.19 civilians died at the following addresses:<br>55, 57 and 59 Woodville Avenue<br>2, 6, 8, 10 and 22 Oakdale Road<br>2, 4, 6, 8, 10 Rose Avenue<br>There were no deaths in Cowslip Road or Maybank Avenue.

The striking thing about the map is that this single V2 strike is so isolated from the rest, and must have been a very lucky hit because it had a material affect on the war effort. The V2 hit in mid-morning while I was in the fourth form classroom at Luton Grammar School, which was three miles away. Within an hour we were told that the Commer lorry works was badly damaged. My father worked there. Later that day he told the story of what happened – the worst damage was in the canteen. My father was on the other side of a wall, on the works floor, where there was significant blast damage but no casualties. There were body parts in the trees outside, I don’t know the exact number killed. At this time in 1944 the Commer works was still turning out vehicles for the expeditionary force then fighting its way to Germany. Full production was resumed within a week, but the V2 left a terrifying memory of unheralded death from above. PS My wife Mimi was on the receiving end of both V weapons. On August 2 1944 her home in Troutbeck Road, New Cross, was destroyed by a V1 at 6.31 am. The family were in a shelter in the garden and presumed dead by the rescue workers, but they were all alive. Four people in the house next door died. Then Mimi lost friends in the dreadful V2 strike on the Woolworths in Deptford one Saturday morning – Mimi wrote a piece about this for the Daily Mail some years ago. We've been looking at the available accounts on line prompted by D-Day because on that day we blissfully assumed that the war was over for us. Fat chance.",-0.426654,51.888736

The devastation was quite large:All the houses for 50 yards along the corner of Cleveland Road and Downham Road down to Southgate Road were obliteratedAll the houses for 50 yards along Southgate Road backing on to Cleveland Road were obliteratedAll the houses for 75 yards along Downham Road to Southgate Road (opposite Cleveland Road)  backing on to what is now Rosemary Gardens were obliteratedThe properties on the other side of the Southgate Road / Downham Road were left standing with very little damageI was told that the blast came from the east and was virtually in the centre of the junction of Downham Road and Southgate Road and that there vehicles in the crater in the road.In the middle of what is now Rosemary Gardens was the Old Lead Mills that was completely intact up until it was demolished in the 1960s, I don't think that this building could have survived a V2 incident if it fell as indicated, also, my dad had a garage about 10 yards from the indicated strike point in the alleyway off Downham Road backing on to Rosemary Gardens that was untouched.This whole area of devastation was a great playground for us the 1950's and 60's and is very clear in my mind even now.Regards,Lawrence McNamara",-0.085756,51.539496

190,Archway,"November 5, 1944<br><br>Comment from Marty: ""Re: The Archway (Highgate) V2 Rocket attack. This happened before I was born but the story I was told from my parents and elder siblings was that this bomb fell on a bonfire night in 1944 around 5pm. There is now a block of flats called Bowerman Court which are situated between St. John's Way and Grovedale Road. The bomb landed by a house hosting a young girl's 5th birthday party. Needless to say, they were all wiped out. My Father was home on leave and was inside our house (opposite) with my Mother and my older Brother, then a babe in arms. My Mother had just brought him from the front room to the rear of the house (Kitchen) and laid him in a cot. My father was reading the paper and the next thing he knew was my Mother crying out ""My Baby, My Baby"" and a hissing sound and completed darkness. A young ARP boy was dragging him out over rubble. There were light's set up in the street (Grovedale Rd) and there were bodies covered over. They brought my elder brother out, (the baby) covered in soot. The corner house, which was the end of the terrace and very large, with an airy, was completely demolished and was a bomb ruin until the 70's. My Father had family in Somer's Town (St Pancras) and his brother was coming to Sunday Tea that early evening. He was told by the ARP's that everybody along that stretch of terraced houses had perished. He in turn went home and told my Grandparent's that the whole family was wiped out. It was a miracle that they survived. Day's after they returned to the house to find several of the terraced houses had no front's ,roofs, 1 st floor's or facing wall's but the dado rails were still connected to the few vertical wall's that were left standing.They were free standing. No brick's behind, just joined from one wall to the other at about 6 ft. high. When the bomb landed, the blast blew off our kitchen door and this straddled the cot which held my Brother.He was buried but miraculously unharmed. My Father was reading the Sunday paper at the time and my Mother was standing in front of Him brushing her hair in a mirror over the fireplace. A gas meter had been blown from it's bracket up the hall down the passage passing through the kitchen between my Mum's face and the mirror and embedding itself in the wall next to my father's chair which he was sitting. The glass from the kitchen window had blown in and shard's of glass had embedded themselves in the mirror. How they weren't touched by the glass and gas meter is a miracle.They knew of all this, as they visited the sight in daylight a few day's later and could see the extent of the damage, And those poor rioter's have had it hard, Bless.""<br><br>From Brian Simmons: ""I was a child living in St.Johns Way during the war years (and after) and well remember this particular V2 I was away for the weekend with my parents,visiting my grandmother in Cambridgeshire. When we returned home on the Monday morning we found our house severely damaged but standing; most terribly the rocket had fallen on or close to a party which was being attended by lots of my friends.

The corner of Wykeham School on the opposite corner now is different to that that existed pre war. Pre war that part of the school was single storey, with a pitched roof to match the connecting two storey block. Post war, that corner part is a two storey flat roof building, although the original two storey main building with its pitched roo f remain s the same externally. This suggests to me that the impact point was actually in Aboyne Road, just south west of the junction with Annersley Close. This would account for the new housing post war and the rebuilding of that part of the school. Other housing in the area shows a common design of roof and wall rendering, all totally different from the 1947/48 housing.<br><br><br>Done some more searching. as a result I can addyhat this Neasden attack was on Thursday 15 March 1945 @ 22:57.

234,Pelham Road,"1944<br> <br>Based on reader comment from Ron Ring: "" I remember that day so well. It was sometime in the autumn of 1944, I was 10 years old and lived in Russell Ave, Wood Green, and my nan was looking after me. There was an almighty bang, far bigger than those we were used to, which violently shook the house. I didn't know where the bomb fell but I knew it was close by and in which direction. My mum worked at Cullens Grocers near Jolly Butchers Hill. I knew she would be worried about us, as I was for her. I decided I would run to tell her that we were both alright. My route took me into Gladstone Avenue. I had been used to seeing bombed houses immediately after a bomb attack, but it was usually of one or two houses. I had also seen the devastation of the V1 flying bomb that had landed in Bury Road/ West Beech Road. But this looked like the whole street of over twenty houses, and behind that I could see that Pelham Road had suffered the same fate, exposing the railway embankment and station behind it. The devastation of the V2 was collosal. Dogs running in panic aimlessly, scared out of their wits, People bloodied and dazed standing amongst the debris. Smoke and dust was still rising from the mess. The houses on the opposite side were also severely damaged, perhaps saved from some of the blast by the air-raid shelters that had been built along the centre of the road. Damage to these, nevertheless, was extensive. What surprised me the most was an upright piano that must have been SUCKED OUT through the window of one of these houses and landed into the front garden. I continued my journey to let mum know that we were OK and she was, of course relieved, but I warned her of what she would see on her way home. We kids were, as most of us London wartime kids were at the time, relatively poor and had to make the best of everything to keep ourselves occupied. Most of our dad's were in the army, our mums were at work, so we kept ourselves amused as best we could. Bomb sites became our playgrounds. We would jump out from first floor windows into perhaps a pile of sand that that builders had left. We would steal the toilet cistern copper ballcocks from derelict houses and throw them on to the bonfire that invariably was burning on the site and watch them explode with one half flying high into the air. I can't now understand how we didn't manage to cause ourselves injury. I realise that by present day standards it would be classed as vandalism, but in war time, people had much more to worry about than kids ""playing"" and keeping happy. There was precious little to be happy about! Much later the bombsites were completely cleared of all debris and danger, they became Speedway Tracks on which we would race our (pedal) bikes and we would have our own teams and names, and invite neighbouring areas teams to compete with us. In some respects, in our play, our childhoods were fun times because we were perhaps too young to completely realise the seriousness of the war, and we had to make our own amusements. But I hope to God that our children and grandchildren etc don't have to go through it EVER.""<br><br><br>Second reader comment from Martin Harriss: ""I have been told that I was in my pram being pushed along Wood Green High Road when it fell, and was covered in dust and pieces of rubble - presumably small pieces. Iwas born in September 1944 and would be very interested to know the date and time of this event.""",-0.107814,51.595528

If you look on Google maps the site is in between Cedars Road and Bushy Park Road, next to the railway line.""<br><br>And from reader Paul Harding: ""I can confirm that a V2 did land on part of the gas works on Sandy Lane. I was about two and a half at the time and was apparently blown out of my cot right across the front bedroom of 16 Bushy Park Road where my grandparents lived. As this was several hundred yards from the impact it must have caused a lot of local damage. It's worth noting that Eisenhower's Allied HQ was in the southern end of Bushy Park, just over the wall from the gas works, so it only just missed a very important target. I can remember the gas works was up and running again in 1947/8 as I used to go with my grandfather to collect bags of coke for the kitchen stove at No 16. """,-0.319065,51.417195

As a side remark the Rochester Way had a long series of burners which were placed every 50 yards.

It took out the fronts of all the houses facing the shrubbery. As I was 7 at the time I remember the aftermath. However after reading about the area of devastation caused by these V2's and the fact that my parents and I survived, ( My Parents were in bed and literally hanging out the front of the house which was completely gone) I wonder if it was really a V2 since your map does not show a strike at this address. Do you have any data about a bomb/rocket strike at this address.",0.055211,51.568301

304,Ratly Hills Wood,"0 dead. Comment from 'MikeC': A V2 landed on the very top of the hill at Ratly Hill Woods. Exact date unknown, but late in 1944. I was four years old and playing in my back yard when it landed and can clearly remember the surreal experience of seeing first the explosion, then hearing the bang, followed by the rushing noise of the rocket going ""back up"" into the sky.<br>There were no dead or injured at the time, but a serious injury many years later. A woodcutter was sawing pit props for the Kent collieries using a 36"" circular saw driven from the power take off of a tractor. He cut into a log that contained an embedded shard of the rocket casing, causing the saw blade to disintegrate and almost sever his arm at the shoulder.",0.507131,51.431551

It happened just before Christmas ( 19th Dec '44 ? ) I was walking with a friend up Townsend Rd. & we were admiring the stars when we saw what looked like a shooting star. However, this shooting star was zigzagging toward the earth. We looked at each other & dropped to the street. Nothing happened. We laughingly went to get on our feet when there was a very bright flash , a loud rumble & the ground swayde beneath our feet. We 12 year olds ran like hell.

We were living about a mile away and I well remember sitting in our dining room with my mother and father. (at Durley Avenue).      It was very eerie at first.   Our heavy velvet curtains suddenly billowed out and rose to the ceiling and then came the explosion followed by a fading sound of the rocket.     It cracked one of our windows, but that was the only damage we suffered.<br><br>Corroborated here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a7999933.shtml",-0.367827,51.591116
